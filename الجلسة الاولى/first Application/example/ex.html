    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. <br>
    It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. <br>
    HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to structure and present content on the internet. <br>
    HTML documents consist of a series of elements or tags that define the structure, formatting,
    and functionality of web pages. <br> 
    These elements are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) and are usually paired with opening and closing tags. <br>
    The content of the web page is placed between these tags. <br>
    HTML provides a wide range of elements and attributes to structure content, <br>
    create headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, media, and more. <br> 
    It also supports the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity to web pages. <br>
